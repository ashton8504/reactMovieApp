## What I Learned

While building this project, I learned several important concepts and skills:

- **React Components:** I gained experience in creating reusable components and managing their state and props.
- **API Integration:** I learned how to make HTTP requests to an external API and handle the received data in my application.
- **React Hooks:** I utilized hooks like useState and useEffect to manage component state and perform side effects.
- **Conditional Rendering:** I practiced conditionally rendering components based on certain states or data availability.
- **Responsive Design:** I implemented responsive design techniques using CSS to ensure the application looks good on different devices.
- **Project Organization:** I learned how to structure a React project and organize components, styles, and other files effectively.

## Future Improvements

While this project provides basic functionality, there are several areas for improvement:

- **Pagination:** Implement pagination support to allow users to navigate through multiple pages of search results.
- **Error Handling:** Enhance the error handling mechanism to gracefully handle cases where the API request fails or returns an error.
- **UI Enhancements:** Add more styling and visual elements to improve the user experience and make the application more visually appealing.
- **Movie Details Page:** Create a separate page to display more detailed information about a selected movie.
